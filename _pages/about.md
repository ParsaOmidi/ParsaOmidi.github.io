I am a highly dedicated and experienced Machine Learning and Computer Vision Researcher, with a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Western University, Canada. For the past seven years, my work has revolved around signal processing, image processing, and AI, with a specific focus on biomedical imaging and computational optics. My expertise lies in developing advanced processing tools for optical systems, utilizing a wide range of programming languages and libraries, including Python, MATLAB, C#, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. My research contributions have been applied across various domains, including medical imaging, microscopic imaging, morphological imaging, light field display, and neuromorphic computing.


I'm a firm believer that two heads are better than one, especially when it comes to tackling complex problems. So if you have a brilliant idea, let's join forces and make some AI magic happen!
