I'm a Data Scientist and ML Engineer with a Master's Degree in Data Science. My experience is related to providing end-to-end data solutions in the B2C industry. I'm passionate about data and I'm always looking for new challenges to improve my skills.

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at [PromoFarma](https://www.promofarma.es/), a Spanish e-commerce company focused on modernizing the health and beauty sector. Some of my tasks here involve the development of machine learning models to predict the demand of products, recommender systems to increase user engagement, or NLP models to extract information from unstructured data, alongside the data pipelines to automate the process of data collection, cleaning, and analysis.

I love doing sports, in particular [CrossFit](https://santandreucrossfit.com) and cycling. I also enjoy deeply traveling and learning new languages so I can better comprehend other cultures. I'm currently learning German on the hope to be able to visit Germany and Austria more often in the near future.
