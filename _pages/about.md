I'm a Data Scientist and ML Engineer with a Master's Degree in Data Science used to work in end-to-end data problems in the B2C industry. I'm passionate about data and I'm always looking for new challenges to improve my skills.

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at [PromoFarma](https://www.promofarma.es/), a Spanish e-commerce company focused on modernizing the health and beauty sector. Some of my tasks here involve the development of machine learning models to predict the demand of products, recommender systems to increase user engagement, the development of NLP models to extract information from unstructured data and the development of data pipelines to automate the process of data collection, cleaning, and analysis.

I love doing sports, in particular [CrossFit](https://santandreucrossfit.com) and cycling. I also love to travel and to learn new languages and discover new cultures.
